# Santa Barbara County Landcover Classification
# Introduction

*Credit: This project is based on materials developed by Chris Kibler.

Monitoring the distribution and change in land cover types can allow us to gain insights into the impacts of climate change, natural disasters, deforestation, urbanization, and over major phenomena. This is a major application of remote sensing due to the ability to distinguish different materials based on their spectral reflecance from this process, especially in large areas.

# Purpose of Study

The purpose of this study is to use a decision tree classifier, a form of supervised classification, to classify land cover in Santa Barbara County. This will examine 4 land cover types using multi-spectral imagery. The land cover types include:

      green vegetation

      dry grass or soil

      urban

      concrete

      water

# Data

    Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper

      Landsat 5

      1 scene from September 25, 2007

      bands: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7

      Collection 2 surface reflectance product

    Study area and training data

      polygon representing southern Santa Barbara county

      polygons representing training sites

      type: character string with land cover type
